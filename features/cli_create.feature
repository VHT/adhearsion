Feature: Adhearsion Ahn CLI (Create)
  As an Adhearsion user
  I want the ahn command to allow creating an app
  So that I can write an Adhearsion app

  Scenario: Generate application with valid layout
    When I run `ahn create path/somewhere`
    And I cd to "path/somewhere"
    Then the following directories should exist:
      | app/assets/audio      |
      | app/assets/audio/en   |
      | app/call_controllers  |
      | lib                   |
      | config                |
      | config/locales        |
      | script                |
      | spec                  |
      | spec/call_controllers |
      | spec/support          |

    And the following files should exist:

      | Procfile                                  |
